# Item Catalog

The application Item Catalog allows users to maintain a list of items, and to manage these items in categories.

As Google+ was decomissioned in March 2019, the login method taught in the course stopped working. The code used in this project was kindly provided by Shyam Gupta in the knowledge exchange section of the course: https://gist.github.com/shyamgupta/d8ba035403e8165510585b805cf64ee6

## Prerequisites

The program runs in a virtual machine and requires a couple of prerequisites to be fulfilled:
	- Vagrant needs to be installed on the host machine. The program has been tested and developed with Vagrant 2.2.3.
	- VirtualBox needs to be installed on the host machine. The program has been tested and developed with VirtualBox 6.0.
	- A virtual machine based on the Full Stack Nanodegree VM (FSDN) runnning on the host:
          - Download the VM configuration from https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip
          - Unzip the downloaded file and `cd` into the created diredctory `FSND-Virtual-Machine`
          - Change directory into `vagrant`
          - Run `vagrant up` to start the VM
          - Login to the VM using `vagrant ssh` and change the working directory to `/vagrant`
	- The application uses Google as an OAuth provider. Using the application will require to register it at https://console.developers.google.com and to obtain a Client ID and a Client Secret from there.

## Installation

- Put all files from this repository into the `/vagrant` folder of the VM
- Login to the VM using `vagrant ssh`
- Add your Client ID in line 10 of file login.html
- Save your Client Secret in file client_secrets.json in the /vagrant folder of the VM

## Execution

- If the VM is not running, start it with `vagrant up`
- Login to the VM using `vagrant ssh`
- Change the working directory to /vagrant
- Start the application with `/usr/bin/python project.py`

The program starts a web server that listens on http://localhost:5000
